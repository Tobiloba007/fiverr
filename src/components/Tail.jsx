                I'm James Anderson a former radio journalist, accountant, business enterpreneur
                 and more recently a film writer and producer. - I originated the concept and script
                  for the feature film Angelina - Queen of Coffee and have shown my commitment and
                   passion to the project by self financing the film and helping with its extensive
                    creative development. I run my own bespoke consumer litigation company which was
                     featured in the FT and Yorkshire Post for its work in helping consumers with
                      credit rating errors. My company is the first of its kind in the UK to offer
                       this specialised legal service.
